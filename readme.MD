# Vaydeer-Keypad-Linux
A simple script which allows the Vaydeer 9-key keypad to work on Linux.

## Note:
This only re-enables the keypads functionality, and uses the already set on-board memory bindings.
It does not modify bindings, and it does not allow the remapping of keys.

## Usage:
Set script to run in `crontab` or wherever you manage your (root) startup scripts.
You won't notice the script running, just try to use the keypad. If it doesn't work, this script is out of date or you did something wrong.

Verified working as of 12/25/24 (Merry Christmas)
